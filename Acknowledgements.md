The majority of authentication code, namely usage of express.session middleware, is attributed to code in homework05, some of which was provided with the assignment and not written by myself. 

Any code taken from the above-mentioned or other sources are directly acknowledged in comments, and in the below list: 
- [auth.mjs](./src/auth.mjs) is largely taken and adapted from auth.mjs in homework05, of which some of the code was provided and not written by myself
