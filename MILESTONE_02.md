Special Instructions for Using Form (or Login details if auth is part of your project)
---
Create a new user under the register page or login using credentials username: username1234; password: password1234. 
The account page isn't implemented yet, but you will have begun an authenticated session. 
Unfortunately, I do not have a log out button yet but if you do restart the app, you will see you are unable to reach the /account path without logging in first. 

URL for form 
---
(TODO: add link to a functioning form; okay to use temporary domain of your own codespaces container)

URL for form result
---
(TODO: if applicable, add link to page that shows results of submitting form)

URL to github that shows line of code where research topic(s) are used / implemented
--- 
All research code is inside [testing.html](./testing/testing_leaflet.html) and [testing.js](./testing/testing_leaflet.js)
